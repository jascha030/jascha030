### Hello there

> Read the title in Ewan McGregor's voice for the full experience.

I am a Full-stack Webdeveloper specializing in
* **PHP** Composer, laravel and Wordpress
* Typescript, Angular, Ionic, React, Preact
* Javascript, Webpack, jQuery (if anybody cares, I sure know I don't)
* CSS, SCSS, LESS

Full-stack, but Back-end Php by preference.

With a fair amount of experience in
* C# (mainly Unity related)
* Java
* Shellscript (Bash/ZSH/vimscript)

And sometimes dabling in
* Objective-C
* Lua
* Ruby
* Python

I have been working 5+ years as a developer, Back-end developer and "Back-end Wordpress" developer @ [Social Brothers](https://socialbrothers.nl) in Utrecht, the Netherlands. You could say senior, but I prefer Señor Developer🌶 (si).

Next to that I also...
* [Am a self-proclaimed musician*](https://soundcloud.com/jassie030)
* Have a background in digital design
* Am a failed Game-artist
* Hoarder of "cool" stuff (Used to be mainly sneakers and Star Wars stuff, but shifted more toward Vinyl, CD's, Cassette's, and music gear)
* Have a weird love-hate relationship with Wordpress. (Not a fan of it's codebase, but it's what I worked with the most in the past 8 years or so. I know it inside out and am on a constant mission to improve the development experience by applying modern PHP in combination with loads of cool composer packages like a bunch of the `symfony` components, a variety of `psr-11` Containers, like: `pimple/pimple` and `php-di/php-di`, template engines like `blade` or `twig/twig`. To name a few of my efforts.

I love to Nerd-out about
* Music gear, software and Synths 🎹
* Music, preferably; Electro, Hip-hop, Italo-disco, New/Dark/Synth-wave, anything prefixed by "Acid-", Rave, Jungle/D&B & "Hot Sax" 🎷.
* Music gear, software and Synths 🎹
* Star Wars 🚀 Formula 1 🏎
* Modern (pop) Art 🖼 
* Sneakers (not yeezy's tho :hehehehe:) 👟
