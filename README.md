### Hello there

> Read the title in Ewan McGregor's voice for the full experience.

I am a Full-stack Webdeveloper specializing in
* **PHP** Composer, Symfony, Laravel and Wordpress
* **Typescript/Javascript**, Angular, Ionic, React, Svelte, Webpack and jQuery
* **CSS**, SCSS and PostCSS

With a fair amount of experience in
* C#(Mainly Unity), Java, Shell(Bash/ZSH/Vimscript)
* 
And sometimes dabling in
* Objective-C, Lua, Rust, Ruby, Python.

I have been working 5+ years as a developer, Back-end developer and "Back-end Wordpress" developer @ [Social Brothers](https://socialbrothers.nl) in Utrecht, the Netherlands. I prefer beinc called Señor Developer🌶 (si).

Next to that I also...
* [Am a self-proclaimed musician*](https://soundcloud.com/jassie030)
> \* Read "musician" as "gearhead" who accidentaly creates 🔥 on occasion.

* Have a background in graphical design and am a failed game-artist student.
* Hoarder of "cool" stuff (Used to be mainly sneakers and Star Wars stuff, but shifted more toward Vinyl, CD's, Cassette's, and music gear)
* Have a weird love-hate relationship with Wordpress. (Not a fan of it's codebase, but it's what I worked with the most in the past 8 years or so. I know it inside out and am on a constant mission to improve the development experience by applying modern PHP in combination with loads of cool composer packages like a bunch of the `symfony` components, a variety of `psr-11` Containers, like: `pimple/pimple` and `php-di/php-di`, template engines like `blade` or `twig/twig`. To name a few of my efforts.

I love to Nerd-out about
* Music gear, software and Synths 🎹
* Music, preferably; Electro, Hip-hop, Italo-disco, New/Dark/Synth-wave, anything prefixed by "Acid-", Rave, Jungle/D&B & "Hot Sax" 🎷.
* Star Wars 🚀, Formula 1 🏎, Modern (pop) Art 🖼  and Sneakers (not yeezy's tho :hehehehe:) 👟
